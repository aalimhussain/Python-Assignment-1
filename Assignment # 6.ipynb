    "Question 1: \n",
    "Define Object Oriented Programming Language? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "OOP:\n",
    "Object Oriented Programing as clear from Name that it Deals with objects which has cetrain properties too.\n",
    "In Programing Object Oriented means that we create intances of cleases having objects and some initializers modules\n",
    "and Methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: \n",
    "List down the Benefits of OOP? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:\n",
    "~ OOP is faster and easier to execute \n",
    "~ OOP provides a clear structure for the programs \n",
    "~ OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY \"Don't Repeat Yourself\", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug \n",
    "~ OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: \n",
    "Differentiate between function and method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "-Function = Python method is called on an object, unlike a function. In our example above, \n",
    "we call start() on the object ‘car’. Conversely, we call Python function quite generically\n",
    "we don’t call it on any object. Since we call a method on an object, it can access the data within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Method = A method may alter an object’s state, but Python function usually only operates on it, \n",
    "and then prints something or returns a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4: \n",
    "Define the following terms: 1. Class 2. Object 3. Attribute 4. Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "-Class: The class is a blueprint that defines a nature of a future object\n",
    "\n",
    "-Object: an object can be a data structure, a variable or a function. It has a memory location allocated. \n",
    "The object is designed as class hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Attribute: Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or \n",
    "quality of the class. One can think of attributes as noun or adjective, while methods are the verb of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Behavior: Behaviors are the methods corresponding to the behavior of real world objects\n",
